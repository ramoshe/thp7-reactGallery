# thp7-reactGallery
 My seventh project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program at Treehouse

 ## Please Note:
 The app is contained within the `gallery` folder. 
 
 Use `npm install` and then `npm start` to run the app.

 In order to load the photos from flickr you must include a `config.js` file inside the `src` folder that contains the following code:
 ```
const apiKey = '1234567890';
export default apiKey;
 ```
Replace the numbers with your own API key. If you don't already have an API key, [you can get one here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/).
