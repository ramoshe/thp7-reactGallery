### API Key Instructions
In order to load the photos from flickr you must include a `config.js` file inside the `src` folder that contains the following code:
```
const apiKey = '1234567890';
export default apiKey;
```
Replace the numbers with your own API key. If you don't already have an API key, [you can get one here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/).
